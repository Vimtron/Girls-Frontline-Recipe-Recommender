IDEAS: 
	Support for multiple languages?
    Maybe allow for searching for T-dolls by index number?
    Allow user to favorite recipes? Make sure to save things like what item the recipe is for and what not.
    Allow for user to specify tier level?
    Allow for specifying a default production level?
    Add a cache?
    Check config file inputs
    Check settings changes user inputs
    
PROBLEMS:
    If there is a lot of recipes, the crafting page takes a bit too long to load
